# Infrastructure

This directory contains Terraform configurations for infrastructure as code.

## Structure

- `modules/` - Reusable Terraform modules
- `environments/` - Environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)

## Usage

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan deployment
terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"

# Apply changes
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
```

## Best Practices

- Use remote state management with Azure Storage
- Tag all resources appropriately
- Use variables for environment-specific values
- Include resource naming conventions
- Implement proper RBAC and security controls

## Module Development

When creating new modules:
1. Include proper variable validation
2. Add comprehensive documentation
3. Include examples of usage
4. Follow Terraform best practices
5. Version your modules appropriately
